# SUTD Temp Declaration Bot
This is a bot that will automatically fill up the temperature declaration form while the script is running. It will save you the hassle of visiting the temperature declaration site everyday, whilst still conforming to the school regulations.

# How to use:
Download the chrome webdriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. 

Place the webdriver under C:\Program Files (x86). Alternatively, you may put the file under another directory, but you will need to update the path to the webdriver in main.py.

Create a file titled "pw.txt" and "username.txt" that contains your password an username respectively. Place the files under the same directory as main.py.

To start the programme, simply run main.py
