# How to use:
Download the chrome webdriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. 

Place the webdriver under C:\Program Files (x86). Alternatively, you may put the file under another directory, but you will need to update the path to the webdriver in main.py.

Create a file titled "pw.txt" and "username.txt" that contains your password an username respectively. Place the files under the same directory as main.py.

To start the programme, simply run main.py
